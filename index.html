  <p> Welcome to this experience of interactive audiovisuals made with p5js.
    <br>The simplicity of a single geometric shape is the core feature of this series of projects, which through its
    repetition becomes a complex geometric composition, similar to organic shapes.
    <br> <br>
    Follow the arrow and discover the multiple interactions of every project.
    Have fun!
